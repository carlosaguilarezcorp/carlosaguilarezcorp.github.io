On this page, you will find a set of exercises related to the quality assurance process inside software development projects. The purpose of these exercises is to evaluate knowledge in quality assurance terms and concepts as well as your skills with documenting, organizing and development of test scenarios.</p><p class="lead">Good luck!</p></div><div class="row"><div class="col-xl"><div class="card"><div class="card-body"><h4 class="card-title">Instructions:</h4><h6>Read carefully the description for each exercise and develop the deliverables required.</h6><h6>You can use any tool to work in the deliverables but the documents to deliver at the end must be in PDF format.</h6></div></div></div></div><div class="row pt-3"><div class="col-xl"><div class="card"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title">Excercise #1</h5><h6>Description</h6><hr><p class="card-text">The company X20DF will release his streaming service for all their old and upcoming movies the next year in the US and Mexico. This platform will work as a subscription service like Netflix or Disney+. The service will have multiple subscription plans depending on the number of devices and the country. Below are the subscription plans for the first release:</p><table class="table table-bordered"><thead class="thead-dark"><tr><th>Name</th><th># of devices</th><th>Price</th><th>Countries available</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Individual</td><td>1</td><td>$ 9.99</td><td>US, MX</td></tr><tr><td>Family</td><td>2</td><td>$ 14.99</td><td>US, MX</td></tr><tr><td>Big Family</td><td>4</td><td>$ 19.99</td><td>US</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="card-text">The subscription plan will charge monthly to customers. If the customer is unable to pay the subscription, the system will charge 5% of the subscription price per day until the customer pays the subscription price + late fee. The customers can cancel the service at any moment but only if the service is already paid for the current month. Also, the customers will be able to upgrade or downgrade their service plan at any moment.</p><h6>Problem</h6><hr><p class="card-text">The first round of user acceptance testing has been not satisfactory, the UAT team found a considerable number of bugs in the system. The main issue is that the system is not charging the right amount after doing other transactions first like upgrading the subscription plan.</p><p class="card-text">Another concern is the lack of documentation for the number of test cases and how they are being organized by the QA team. The names of the test cases don’t follow a convention and are difficult to find in the test case repository. Below are some examples for the name of the test cases:</p><ul><li>Plan Family Create USA</li><li>CancelPlanLateFee4</li></ul><p class="card-text">The company decided to change the QA team for the project and that’s why you were brought in. The company requires you to work in the first deliverables detailed in the next section.</p><h6>Deliverables</h6><hr><ul><li>The naming convention for the test case names. </li><li>A list with the names of the test cases that you consider necessary to cover at least 90% of the system’s functionality. (Only the name of the test cases)</li><li>Document how you calculated the testing coverage. You can add any type of diagram, tables, etc.</li><li>Any document that you consider necessary to understand your logic behind the other deliverables.</li></ul></div><div class="card-footer bg-dark"></div></div></div></div><div class="row pt-3"><div class="col-xl"><div class="card"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title">Exercise #2</h5><h6>Description</h6><hr><p class="card-text">2gO is a taxi company that is designing his first applications to connect customers with his taxi service.

The test plan doesn’t have to include technical details like the tools to use for testing (you can add them if you want to).
