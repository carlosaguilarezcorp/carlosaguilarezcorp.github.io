                        p.card-text The subscription plan will charge monthly to customers. If the customer is unable to pay the subscription, the system will charge 5% of the subscription price per day until the customer pays the subscription price + late fee. The customers can cancel the service at any moment but only if the service is already paid for the current month. Also, the customers will be able to upgrade or downgrade their service plan at any moment.

                        p.card-text The first round of user acceptance testing has been not satisfactory, the UAT team found a considerable number of bugs in the system. The main issue is that the system is not charging the right amount after doing other transactions first like upgrading the subscription plan.
                        p.card-text Another concern is the lack of documentation for the number of test cases and how they are being organized by the QA team. The names of the test cases don’t follow a convention and are difficult to find in the test case repository. Below are some examples for the name of the test cases:
                        ul
                            li Plan Family Create USA
                            li CancelPlanLateFee4
                        p.card-text The company decided to change the QA team for the project and that’s why you were brought in. The company requires you to work in the first deliverables detailed in the next section.

                            li A list with the names of the test cases that you consider necessary to cover at least 90% of the system’s functionality. (Only the name of the test cases)
                            li Document how you calculated the testing coverage. You can add any type of diagram, tables, etc.
                            li Any document that you consider necessary to understand your logic behind the other deliverables.

                        p.card-text Your main task as part of the QA team for the design phase is to develop a test plan for the project. The test plan must include all the testing definitions and steps for the system’s components, the test plan details how and when the process should be executed during the project.
